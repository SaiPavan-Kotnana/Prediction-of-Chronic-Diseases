# Prediction of Chronic Diseases
 Prediction of Heart,Diabetes and parkinson's using machine learning techniques creating  user interface

The three leading causes of fatalities in today's world are heart disease, diabetes, and 
Parkinson's disease, often resulting in persistent illnesses that significantly impact the quality of 
life. Recent advancements in various Internet of Things (IoT) domains have leveraged Machine 
Learning (ML) techniques to identify key traits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of disease 
prediction. Utilizing both Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms 
for all three diseases, promising results have been achieved. Logistic Regression demonstrates an 
accuracy rate of 91.4% for heart disease, while SVM achieves accuracy levels of 96.2% for 
diabetes and 88.4% for Parkinson's disease. These outcomes underscore the potential of ML in 
early disease identification, thereby enabling proactive healthcare management. To facilitate user 
interaction and make the system more accessible, an intuitive web application has been 
developed as part of this integrated prediction system. This application empowers users to 
engage with predictive capabilities, further enhancing the early detection of these diseases and 
promoting proactive healthcare management. 

MACHINE LEARNING 
Machine learning is a dynamic field within artificial intelligence that empowers computers 
to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time. It operates on the 
premise that algorithms and models can automatically detect patterns and make predictions by 
analyzing vast datasets, without being explicitly programmed. This capability enables machine 
learning to be incredibly versatile, finding applications in various domains such as healthcare, 
finance, natural language processing, autonomous systems, and more. Machine learning is 
particularly useful due to its ability to extract meaningful insights and predictions from complex 
and large-scale data, which can be challenging for humans to process manually. For instance, in 
healthcare, it aids in disease prediction and diagnosis by sifting through patient records, genetic 
information, and medical imagery to identify risk factors and markers associated with various 
diseases. In finance, it enhances fraud detection by analyzing transaction data to identify unusual 
patterns and flag potentially fraudulent activities. In autonomous vehicles, it enables self-driving 
cars to perceive and respond to their environment by processing sensor data in real-time. This 
transformative technology continues to drive innovation and improve decision-making processes 
across industries, making systems smarter and more efficient. Fig 1.1 shows the types of machine
